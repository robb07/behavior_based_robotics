Files to program a VEX Robot with a Behavior Based Robotics Architecture

This is my repository for code that I'm developing to implement behavior based robotics on my VEX robot.
I compile this code in ROBOTC v3.6 onto a VEX cortex processor. Some of the oddities of the code structure 
compared to ordinary C are due to ROBOTC's limitations (e.g. only one C file can be compiled because 
there's no linker so some functions are in headers)

Code Description:
=================
The main file to run all of the behaviors is currently level0Competency.c. This file uses includes to 
pull in the header files that contain the individual behaviors (e.g. collide.h). Other .c files include 
their respective header and any necessary supporting headers to test that behavior. The .c files are 
used as test files in the development of the header files.

Physical Robot Description:
===========================
The robot is a three wheeled robot with two powered wheels (left, and right) and one unpowered wheel 
with fixed orientation in the back (it drags during turns). The two wheel motors have integrated encoders 
that enable odometry. The robot detects obstacles thru an ultrasonic range sensor that is mounted on a 
'head.' The head is mounted on an axel that is driven by a motor so that the robot can look around. An 
optical encoder allows the robot to track its head angle and two limit switches mounted on either side 
of the head prevent it from tangling its wires.

Many of the behaviors the robot utilizes are adaptable to robots of other physical specs.
